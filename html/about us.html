<P style="font-size: 250%;" class="navstyle">After you say your goodnights there may be one last communication before
you go to sleep, and that’s the, “Made it home” text. The adrenaline of a date
doesn’t end there. If this was one of the best dates you’ve been on and the
chemistry was crazy, going to sleep becomes harder than trying to eat just one
French fry. Remain strong. No phone sex. No nudes. No sexting. No Video
Calls. Nothing! You went on a date; it was good, now put it to rest by putting
your hormones to bed. I don’t care if you stay up thinking about him for the
    next hour, it’s better to crave than to cave</P>
